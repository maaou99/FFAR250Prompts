      <p>Day 1: I picked up a code I wrote a while ago and improved it. I reduced the number of lines of code to increase readability. Meaningful comments were added to the my program to improve the understanding of my code. I also renamed my variables to avoid any confusion. </p>

        <p>&nbsp; Accessibility </p>
      </div>
      <p>Day 2: I posted my code online for others too look at. The social platform I used is github. Github is an online service where users can share code that they have created. It encourages open source code and open access, since it is free and available to all. </p>

      <p>Day 3: Today, I finished coding an animation. The user can interact with the piece by toggling the speed of the animation or the number of squares in my animation. A user-friendly panel allows the user to easily modify certain settings.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; Purpose</p>
      </div>
      <p>Day 4: I have created a list of my future computation projects. Since it is important for each coded animation to have a purpose, I must always brainstorm new ideas and get inspired by my environment, experiences and culture. </p>
      <h4>Future projects </h4>
 
      <ul>
        <li>Animating a pattern found in nature (spider web, tree trunk, the center of a sunflower). As someone who cares about our biodiversity, showing how complex and beautiful nature is may encourage people to realize natures beauty. </li>
        <li>Creating an interactive quiz about the history of Palestine. As someone who close to their origins, I believe shedding light on a narrative we do not hear a lot about will let people understand a different perspective and encourage dialogue.  </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Day 5: I have asked a student in my class to review my code. As seen in the screenshot, she suggests to separate each event into a function. In other words, each step necessary to display the desired visual should belong to only one section of the code. She also recommends to clarify my comments. </p>
