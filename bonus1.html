        <h2>Mama</h2>
         <br><br>
        <p>I cannot think about the essence of love without thinking of your presence beside me. Although it is emotionally difficult to show my love to you, allow me to pour my thoughts and emotions into this letter.</p>
      <br>
        <p>Your affection and strength have built me into who I am today. The way you raised me has taught me that you must always continue to do what you love, no matter what the world tells you. You’ve allowed me to find my passions, encouraging me to strive for success in any field I enter. You believed in me when others didn’t, and I will try my best to make you proud.</p>
      <br>
        <p>You light up every room. Whether through your actions, dialogue or even presence, you made a difference in this world by doing and sharing what you love. I inspire to be someday like you, mama. A strong and determined woman who lived through tragedies but shared nothing but love and purity.</p>
    <p>Since one of the ways you show me love is through language, I will try to remember a few caring words you’ve nourished my soul with throughout the years:</p>
    <br>

        <span>عمري</span>

        <span>حبيبتي</span>
      </div>
        
    </div>
    <p>My hope one day is to be able to nourish you with the same kind of love you’ve given me. Rest assured that your affection will be expressed through my love with you and others.  I am eternally blessed by your presence and grateful to call you my mother.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Your biggest fan, </p>
    <br>
    <p>Mariam.</p>
