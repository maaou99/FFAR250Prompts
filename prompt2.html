              <p>As mentioned in an earlier prompt, code is a tool to create art. One of the many ways code is helpful is through generative art. Generative art are digital pieces of artwork created only with code. From abstract geometric forms to complex patterns, generative art builds visually pleasing artworks. However, since code is the building block of generative art, the program’s overall structure (which results in visual displays) must follow a particular structure and utilize common programming concepts.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Since providing a further meaning of code can become quite technical, A simplified, highly utilized method during the coding process applies to code usage as well as any stage of an art critique.</p>
              <br>
              <p>For the code to be as efficient, meaning it does not take too much storage space and the running time is not too long, it must adhere to specific rules in programming. It must be easy to understand, allowing other artists to engage with the piece. Artistic coders must welcome others within the same field to engage with their code. This method is called “code review.” In order to build coherent, logical, abstract software, the developer must systematically hand out and allow peers to engage with the code. Programmers eventually discuss with their team for improvement and code efficiency. </p>

              <p>James Merrill, a multi-discipline artist living in Vermont, USA, shared his code review on a generative piece of art entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">Fidenza</span>, made by the creative coder Tyler Hobbs (Merrill, n.d). As he analyses the code, he suggests that some parts of the code should be replaced with a component that is less prone to error and avoids unexpected problems. Therefore, a part of code review is to suggest a better way to write sections of the code.</p>
              <br>
              <p>At any stage of programming, letting go of the code and sharing it with others for improvement is a requirement and a learning experience. Like critiquing an art piece, this tool allows the programmer to see their work from another perspective and improve it if required. </p>
